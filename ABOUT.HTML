<li> HISTORY </li>
<br>
<li> The origins of the cupcake remain foggy, the dessert was first documented in 1796 in Amelia Simmons American Cookery. The cupcake
 resurfaced in the 19th century, this time holding two meanings. Before the invention of the muffin tin, small cakes were baked in individual 
 ramekins, hence the name cupcake. </li>
